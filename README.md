# About the  Workforce-Diversity-Analysis Project

Diversity in the workforce is an important factor in fostering innovation, collaboration, and productivity.
This Project analysis utilized the Googleâ€™s publicly available diversity dataset to explore workforce demographics
such as gender, race, and total employment across various sectors from 2014 to 2023.
The objective was to uncover trends, identify areas excelling in diversity, and recommend strategies for improvement.
